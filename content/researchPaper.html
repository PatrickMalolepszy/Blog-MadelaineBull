                <h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>
                <p>After centuries of pollution and pillage brought about by Western greed, the Earth now faces environmental issues that threaten our very existence. A similar phenomenon of cultural genocide resulted in the disempowerment of Native peoples in Canada. As environmentalists look for ways to implement sustainable methods and techniques, many are starting to look towards Indigenous ideologies that prioritize the land and its inhabitants, as a new set of principles to understand and love the Earth while instigating lasting positive change. This project adopts an interdisciplinary perspective to understand the question of Canadian identity through Native ecocriticism. Using the Broad Repko Model as its foundation, this study incorporates the criticism of Native authors Thomas King and Jeannette Armstrong, and non-Native critics Northrop Frye and Margaret Atwood to provide a cultural understanding of Canadians and their land. These combined perspectives are applied to Allootook Ipellie’s “Summit with Sedna” and Lee Maracle’s Celia’s Song which reveal Indigenous knowledge regarding the environment and its connection with its people. It is my hope that through understanding the Native environmental literature of these modern artists, we can gain some integral knowledge to help us adapt to the pressing issues of the environment and induce change that will allow many future generations to enjoy the Earth.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                <p>The severe degradation of the environment over the last centuries has reached such a pinnacle of destruction that the movement towards environmental protection has gained momentum over the last couple of decades. With issues like global warming, loss of biodiversity and human overpopulation threatening the very existence of our planet, caring for Earth has never been more vital. Ecocriticism offers a revolutionary way to learn about the environment, as it applies literary analysis onto creative interpretations of nature. In this way, more people can be introduced to problems facing the environment through a medium that veers from the often cold, analytical deductions of science. However, understanding the complexities of ecocriticism involves taking into considerations the various social, ecological and economical systems and relationships that the issue represents. Therefore, a new model may be presented to look at environmental obstacles, and I propose that model incorporates Indigenous ways of thinking. More specifically, this involves studying the impact and implications of Native ecocriticism on topical Canadian environmental issues, and what this means for Canada’s national identity moving forwards. In understanding the environment through a literary lens, Canadians may view the Earth using an increasingly introspective perspective, leading to a more personalized understanding of their role as stewards and protectors of the planet. Seeing as this issue is complex and currently unresolved due to its intricacies, applying an interdisciplinary approach that requires the problem’s analysis through its multiple dimensions may offer a crucial step towards furthering the knowledge of Native ecocriticism and its affiliations with Native empowerment and environmental threats.</p>

                <p>As an interdisciplinary project, the basis for the interpretation of literature and science will be Repko’s Broad Model, adopted from Introduction to Interdisciplinary Studies. Using these guidelines, the scope of the project will be limited to the disciplines of English, environmental science, history, and anthropology. The English literature used in the project may be further categorized into criticism, and creative writing. The main works of focus include an important anthology of Canadian essays on ecocriticism, Greening the Maple: Canadian Ecocriticism in Context (2013), Alootook Ipellie’s “Summit with Sedna, the Mother of Sea Beasts,” and Lee Maracle’s novel Celia’s Song. Aside from the environmental insight in the articles of Greening the Maple, the text Sustainability: A comprehensive foundation proved invaluable in describing sustainable methods and current environmental issues and their processes. Though English and environmental literature are the two main disciplines incorporated in the study, additional disciplines such as history and anthropology are useful in describing the history of Native Canadians, as well as current dilemmas their societies face and are working on resolving. A novel that critically investigates Canada’s history of Native disenfranchisement and challenges current injustices, is Thomas King’s Inconvenient Indian. Another source of Indigenous ways of life and understanding in terms of community and environment, is Jeannette Armstrong’s Bioneers conference lecture “Human Relationship as Land Ethic.” In her speech, Armstrong relays her knowledge as both an environmental ethicist and as an active Okanagan member, given the role as her community’s land keeper.</p>

                <p>Additional critics used to discuss the ideas of Canadian identity include Margaret Atwood’s Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature and Northrop Frye’s “Selections from The Bush Garden: Essays on the Canadian Imagination (1971).” These texts are considered foundational to understanding Canadian identity. Mainly because they are among the first to address the idea of what Canadian nationhood is and how it is reflected by Canadian writers, and its relevance allows its continual analysis in Canada and around the world. In this project however, though these texts remain important milestones for Canadian literature and cultural analysis, they represent outdated, Eurocentric modes of thinking, and this study aims to present Canadian identity in a new light that encompasses its real founders, Indigenous peoples.</p>

In this project however, though these texts remain important milestones for Canadian literature and cultural analysis, they represent outdated, Eurocentric modes of thinking, and this study aims to present Canadian identity in a new light that encompasses its real founders, Indigenous peoples.</p>

                <p>It is easy to see then, why this study’s question cannot be answered through simply only discipline. Canadian Native ecocriticism implies just through its name the employment of the disciplines English and environmental science, and further implicates the use of history and anthropology to more comprehensively understand the importance of Indigenous activity and knowledge throughout time. Environmental science also encompasses the use of geology, geography and ecology, as the literature used in the project has a strong foundation in place, thereby incorporating the land and organisms that exist within that place. The marriage of these disciplines is most readily digestible in Celia’s Song, which is heavily embedded in environment, history and culture, while incorporating these themes in a creative, literary format.</p>

                <p>Additional disciplines that may have been incorporated include sociology, psychology, philosophy and biology. Luckily, many of these are already absorbed into the more relevant disciplines. For example, a subset of biology is ecology, which is used already to discuss the literature. Similarly, environmental ethics is employed, a specific branch of philosophy. Sociology and psychology had potential in a project such as this, but ultimately the addition of any of these disciplines would convolute the study instead of targeting its integral complexities. On the other hand, if only one discipline was investigated, like English, the scope would be too broad for the project and it would not be as unique or multi-dimensional as an interdisciplinary approach allows for. Lastly, the Repko Model demands that as interdisciplinary writers and critics, we explore our own inherent biases towards the question at hand. For this project, one of my biases that must be taken into consideration is that I am not Native and therefore cannot know all the intricacies of the many Indigenous tribes of Canada, or even begin to understand their historic struggle with this country in which I have never faced racial adversity. As a modern White Canadian, I have been born and continue to live in a society that has colonial roots and capitalist endeavors, and am therefore directly and indirectly affected by this in my ways of thinking. I am also not an expert on all the Native peoples of Canada and therefore am likely to not be as politically correct in the specification of tribes and their communities as I would like to be. Despite my inherent biases, or perhaps because of them, I endeavor to present an informed and insightful case for Native ecocriticism in the development of an inclusive and environmentally aware modern Canadian identity.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Literature Search</h2>

                <p>Before moving into the foundations of literary criticism on Canadian identity, it is important to define ecocriticism as a genre, and what that means in the context of Canadian identity. Nicholas Bradley and Ella Soper’s “Introduction: Ecocriticism North of the Forty-ninth Parallel” from Greening the Maple elaborates on the historical impact of ecocriticism and its future influence on Canadian literature. The paper begins by positing that all texts have an environmental dimension to them, with fellow critic Ricou suggesting Canadian literature has always been ecoliterate in some sense of the term (xvii). Ecocriticism is defined as “the study of the relationship between literature and the physical environment” and presents a new mode to understand the interactions of artists and their Earth (xxi). To understand the complexities of Canadian Native ecocriticism and its role in literary national identity, we will first investigate critics Frye and Atwood and compare them with Indigenous thinkers and artists King and Armstrong, and finally use texts by Ipellie and Maracle to deduce the impact of ecocriticism in Native literature and its contribution to the Canadian canon of literature.</p>

                <p>The efforts of Frye and Atwood in creating the literary basis of Canadian identity cannot be undermined, however, they may be understood through a modern perspective as representing an outdated, traditional way of approaching colonial literature. The two authors point to some deeply rooted psychological issues in early Canadian inhabitants and artists, ultimately suggesting that the Canadian writing and identity are propelled by a fear for nature in which they feel themselves a victim in, or fear losing themselves to. Frye labels this the “garrison mentality:” a physical and psychological distance settlers experienced in the New World that induced a feeling of cultural isolation, causing them to forget their societal values in the face of individuality in the Canadian wilderness (Frye 10). Another source that lends alternative understanding of Frye’s Bush Garden is Linda Hutcheon’s essay titled “Eruptions of Postmodernity: The Postcolonial and the Ecological,” published in 1993 and featured in Greening the Maple. In it, she points to important segments of Frye’s argument that may be interpreted using postmodern methodology. Among these is the idea of Canada as an “imagined community” with a conflicting and delusional identity rendered so by the effects of colonization (Hutcheon 126). This, Hutcheon argues, propelled what became generally known as a Canadian trope, which is the paradox of being simultaneously apart and detached from colonial lifestyle and discourse (131). Interestingly, this identity conflict is also reflected in Frye’s desire to both conquer and absorb the land into a Canadian narrative (Hutcheon 134). This Eurocentric ideology is psychologically detrimental as it establishes a sense of entitlement towards the environment, and as King later states, a sense of ownership over the Native peoples living off the land (80).</p>

                <p>On the other hand, Atwood’s Survival names exactly that, survival, as the driving force behind the inspiration of Canada’s identity (33). Unfortunately, one of the points of criticism in her text is the fact that there is a complete lack of Native writers in her summery of Canadian identity and legacy, even when she describes the role of Indigenous people in Canadian literature. She points out that often Native people are used as projections for their White authors, but essentially Atwood is creating a similar paradox, in which she is talking about Native people, but only through a colonial lens of White writers’ interpretations of Canadian Indigenous knowledge (75).</p>

                <p>One of the central themes of Survival is the victor/victim dynamic, which I argue plays an essential role in Canadians’ traditionally treatment of the earth and Indigenous peoples. Atwood notes that as a colony, Canada has origins as a victim and she postulates that this is what first instilled the victim mentality within its people (36). I believe that it was this mentality in addition to Frye’s assessment of a fear of isolation leading to unwanted self-discovery that lead Canadians to perpetuate their anger at being victims onto the environment, and by extension, Natives. The hurt of feeling powerless in the face of nature led Canadians to exert an overexaggerated sense of control over their surroundings, which included those that loved the land. In her closing statements on Canadian Native literature, Atwood identifies a possible positive outcome for the literary representation of Natives, and that is through their role as mediators between their own culture, and that of White Canadians (103). She suggests we use Indigenous myths as the basis for Canada’s mythology and that this will help in creating a new Canadian identity. Though this sentiment inadvertently offers cultural appropriation as the solution to Canadian identity, there is merit in the potential for Native and European ways of life and literature to come together and learn from one another. In fact, I believe it is the only way Canada as a country can move forward, and I suggest the new medium for hosting this sharing of knowledge is Native ecocriticism. Jeannette Armstrong later perpetuates this ideal, as she aims to “Okanagan-ize” Canadians to see the true value of the environment and the importance of human connections on the land (16:52).</p>

                <p>Ironically, the survival Atwood discusses in her book may be understood with respect to Natives as the survival for their own culture. Thomas King, a writer and Native activist of Cherokee descent, addresses the institutionalized segregation and oppression Native Canadians have endured since the arrival of their White neighbors in his detailed account, The Inconvenient Indian. Among the many injustices regarding the historic treatment of Natives is the breaking of treaties regarding land agreements. King notes that one of the traditionally integral differences between Indigenous people and their White counterparts is the understanding of land. He explains that the Indigenous peoples do not view their land as a commodity, but as having much more valuable qualities as a spiritual, sentimental and cultural place that also provides them with the means to live (218). He also points out that the land is home in more than just abstract ways. King uses the example of the Blackfoot tribe in Alberta living in the shadow of the Ninastiko Mountain who believe that as long as they can see the mountain, they know they are home. In this way, “land participates in the ceremonies and songs” of the people, while also acting as a geographic land marker reflecting a sense of cultural and historic place (218).</p>

                <p>It is understandable then, why removing Natives from their homeland can be very disruptive culturally and psychologically. But this is exactly what the Canadian government has done with Indigenous tribes for centuries, moving them all over the country to areas they deemed less important to White settlement. In addition to this relocation, the government has laws in place such that the land given to Natives is really just on a loan, and eligible for reconsideration if they should want resources on the land, or want to expand their own cities. One of the most famous examples King gives of this injustice is the Oka crisis of 1990, which was a land dispute over a Mohawk reserve and the bordering city of Oka, Quebec, for the building of a golf course (225). The stand-off lasted for 78 days with one fatality before the plans for the golf course were dismissed. King also uses the environmental catastrophe of the Alberta Tar Sands to represent corporate Eurocentric views of land. This ecocide poses a threat to the decreasing supple of fresh water resources, exudes poisonous toxins into the surrounding ecosystem and wildlife, and King believes it is only a matter of time until the dam holding the beds bursts, and the toxins are leeched into the Athabasca River and pollutes many kilometers of environment, and harming those who live in its regions (219-220). For incidents like this to be avoided, we as Canadians need a new dialogue to address environmental concerns and new means of understanding to view land and its value.</p>

                <p>Jeannette Armstrong, member of the Okanagan (or Syilx) tribe in British Columbia and Native activist and artist, shares some of her knowledge growing up on a Native reserve and in the Okanagan community as the basis for her studies in environmental ethics and land conservation. In her interview with David E. Hall entitled “Native Perspectives on Sustainability,” Armstrong names the protection of her homeland, the Sonoran Desert and its surrounding river networks, as essential in her work as an environmentalist (1).  In her Bioneers conference called “Human Relationships as Land Ethic,” Armstrong describes that because of the fragility of this system, it needs increased environmental protection and measures taken against the loss of biodiversity. According to Sustainability, this is called “ecosystem resilience” which is defined as the capacity of an ecosystem to resist damage or recover quickly in the face of an ecological disturbance (427). In addition, the loss of local species is known as “extirpation,” which “poses threats to the integrity and sustainability of ecosystems,” (Theis 133). To counter the land’s low ecosystem resilience and loss of biodiversity, Armstrong and her organization En’owkin Centre have taken on the project of reintroducing endangered plant species traditionally used by Native tribes into the Penicton Reserve (“Land Ethic” 20:50). Not only does this program reestablishing a sense of balance and sustainability, the practice of bringing together people to work on and with the land is very healing, Armstrong explains (21:30).</p>

                <p>In her lecture “Land Ethics,” Armstrong also explains her role as a land speaker and keeper for the land in her community, and the importance behind this role as a representative (1:37). Armstrong reflects the land ideology of King as she explains that the earth is an integral part of Okanagan life, and is effectively incorporated into their very beings, physically and culturally. Armstrong exclaims, “the land is us,” and is even interwoven into the vocabulary the Okanagan people use to describe themselves. The words for female and male are Tłkłamiluh and Sqaltumiah respectively, with their suffixes roughly translating to “land,” thereby visually and phonetically reminding Okanagan peoples that they are from the land and therefore apart of its life cycles (ultimately they are buried and rejoined with the earth and its processes) and have a duty to protect it (4:50). Armstrong notes however, notes that it is not enough to just survive on the land as Atwood describes, rather, she believes it is social and environmental networks that are essential in establishing sustainable practices. Sustainability is described similarly in both its namesake text and by Armstrong in her interview with Hall, with the key difference being that for Armstrong, this mentality is apart of her culture in the harvesting practices which she calls “permaculturing” and water conservation techniques (1-2). In Sustainability, the term is described as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,” (6). Ultimately, I agree with Armstrong that to understand the environment it is vital to repair our human relationships and reproduce the networks reflected by geological pathways and cycles, so that we may assert these onto our understanding of the Earth with increased stewardship.</p>

                <p>A similarity I see between Armstrong’s Indigenous understanding and the Native texts I chose to study, is the link between her role as land keeper and that of shamans and seers. In Ipellie’s “Summit with Sedna,” and Maracle’s Celia’s Song, either under the technique of magic realism or myth, protagonists exist as mediums between their environment and their people, which poses individual and collective difficulties and eventual revelations. In Ipellie’s story, we follow shaman of an Innu tribe that faces a food security crisis as Sedna, the goddess of the Artic seas, is withholding the sea creatures due to her sexual impotency. The narrator acts as the conduit between Sedna and the community, and it is up to him to appease her and bring back the wildlife. However, this is not an individual quest, rather it involves the collaboration of the neighboring tribes to come up with a plan collectively, or all their people will perish (354). In Armstrong’s conference speech, she mentions that Okanagan knowledge follows a system whereby “the visionaries” or artists and creators, are approached when there is a problem they have not faced before (14:31). In a similar mentality, the shamans configure a plan to use a conjured monster to sexually appeal to Sedna, thereby exhibiting the success of creative potential, and the high synergistic motives of the community in understanding problems. The narrator still completes a spirit journey to reach Sedna, indicating the importance of his spiritual role in the community and the rituals necessary to catapult him into the astral realm.</p>

                <p>Linguistically, the story also reflects environmental aspects through assonance which is most exemplified by the repetition of the phrase “release the beasts,” which creates a lulling pattern, reminiscent of the cyclical motion of waves, mirrored by Sedna’s own affiliation with the ocean, and the importance the Arctic waters and its animals holds for the Innu people (Ipellie 354, 355).</p>

                <p>Aside from being used to create conflict, Sedna also acts as a metaphor for the environment, representing the cultural importance of land for the Innu people, and embodying the negative colonial impact their land and people have endured. Sedna’s sexual frustration is brought upon by years of abuse at the hands of her father, a thinly viewed metaphor for the ill-treatment of the White patriarchy aggressively imposing itself the Innu way of life, poisoning its environment, and putting all of the Innu culture at risk with its greed. Environmentally, this may be understood through the negative impact the Eurocentric use of land has had on the Arctic landscape. Most notably, the effects of global warming which are mainly brought about by the burning of fossil fuels, are most concentrated on the polar ice caps and sheets of the Artic, where the ozone layer is most depleted and sun rays most intense (Theis 53). This has had a profoundly negative impact on the wildlife that use the ice to hunt, and on the Innu people’s hunting and ceremonial rituals. Though the present issue of Inuit independence is indeed like the dilemma of “Summit with Sedna,” Ipellie offers a solution which is through the coalition of cultural, artistic and environmental leaders (all represented through the shamanic role) and the increased social capital Armstrong believes is crucial in taking action against the threats facing the environment.</p>

                <p>In Celia’s Song, there are multiple seers and shape-shifters that contribute to the environmental importance of the work, but we will focus on Celia and Jacob. The main conflict of the novel is the havoc wrecked on the community, Native (Sto:lo) and non-Native, following the release of the two-headed snake from its protector position on the reserve’s longhouse. Restless, the quickly angered and vengeful head, grew angry when for centuries he had not been honoured, and forcefully drove himself and the other head Loyal off the longhouse and into a spree of killing and mayhem. The snake is cheered on by the new bones that live beneath the longhouse, who also want vengeance after not being celebrated or participating in the ceremonies of their tribe. This premise reflects the disconnect between the old and new ways Indigenous people live, and the consequential difference between pre-colonization and post-colonization. Though the bones represent entities that are physically and spiritually tied to the land, the new bones feel abandoned, and the unkempt, desolate and stormy landscape reflects their despair.</p>

                <p>Celia witnesses the chaos of the storm the spirits induce, and the destruction of the landscape due to its fury. This may be split into two main environmental threats: coastal erosion and deforestation. The wind plays a large role in the erosion of the bank, which is defined as natural processes that remove, loosen and transport soil, sediment or rock fragments from the landscape by downhill or downwind displacement (Theis 123). Maracle creatively reproduces the effects of erosion, describing the wind as an angry force that “claws at stone, sand, dirt, folds them from their moorings and dumps them in a heap at the end of the point marking the bay,” (3). The wind also specifically targets the cedars, leaving them “crippled,” and uprooting the soil and groundwater they protect (3, 5). This may be interpreted also as a metaphor, with the cedar trees representing a local, cultural symbol with inherent meaning to the Sto:lo community. At other intervals of the text, cedar proves to be a protecting and malleable wood of their tribe. For example, cedar is used in the rebuilding of Stella’s cottage, and therefore signifies the first healthy steps in reconnecting her with the earth, community, earth and Sto:lo values. Another example of the healing powers of cedar occurs when Jacob is first beginning to take on his duties as a seer and he hears voices from the cedar branch he holds, but his frustration with his community’s helplessness brings him to shatter the wood (66). Celia recognizes his spiritual internal struggle and bathes him with the water of the cedar branch he broke, which fills his body and soothes him. In this way, Celia teaches him an aspect of their tribe’s knowledge and rituals, while gently placating him and showing him not to take out his anger on the land, as he “decides not to harm cedar again,” (67). Therefore, the disconnect between the Sto:lo and their culture in Celia’s Song is reflected by the environmental turmoil the bones inflict upon the landscape. Just as Jacob lashes out at the land, so too do the new bones and snake self-inflict (as they are a part of the earth) natural destruction as a result of pain and hopelessness.</p>

                <p>
                    However, Maracle proves that redemption is indeed possible with the collaboration of the community and reestablishment of cultural ceremony and rituals. Celia and Jacob each bring about this change in different ways. Celia accomplishes this through participating in the activities of the family and finally finding a place for herself in the physical world instead of escaping to her spiritual realm. One of the biggest influences this has on the landscape is her project to reinstate a garden that even includes traditional Sto:lo vegetables like camas root. Similarly to Armstrong’s program to reintroduce local and endangered species thereby decreasing extirpation, Celia and the tribe collaboratively locate the root, transplant it, and through physically nourishing the plant they metaphorically culturally nourish and sustain themselves and future generations with Indigenous knowledge. Jacob too brings about a cultural renewal that like the shaman of Ipellie’s tale, requires undergoing a spiritual journey (in this case a visionquest on the mountain of his family), to rebuild the longhouse and restore the snake to its role as protector and lend the tribe ritualistic meaning and cultural remembrance and significance. Through the role of seer, Celia and Jacob act as environmental and cultural leaders of their tribes, instilling knowledge and sustainable practices eloquently described through Maracle’s writing.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

                <p>
                    Using the Repko Model’s guidelines, understanding Native ecocriticism through the disciplines of English, environmental science, history and anthropology are generally synergistic, but there are some areas of conflict that should be addressed. Firstly, it is important to acknowledge the influence of history in the writings of especially older pieces of criticism like that of Atwood and Frye, whose outdated terminology (calling Natives Indians) and ideals are inevitably a product of their time as opposed to our modern understanding of Indigenous culture. However, I know my own biases in prevalent in the matter too, as I have a habit of grouping together Indigenous cultures and rituals as though they could be generalized, when this is truly impossible given the diversity and complexity of the multitude of Native tribes in Canada. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another disciplinary relationship of contention is that between environmental science as a traditionally empiricist tradition, and creative writing. Through my experience researching Native ecocriticism, I found that it can be hard to describe environmental phenomenon using literary terms, without the guise of environmental jargon. I feel my own biases contribute in my difficulty to merge the two cohesively, as the two are often described using different dialogues and terminology in our Westernized society and education systems. The issue with traditional Eurocentric ideals is that there is usually an implied binary, like the one existing between science and arts, when we should start viewing the two as the interconnected systems they present together instead of separately and at odds with one another, The solution to this issue however, remains in ecocriticism itself. If this new genre of interpreting our relationship with Earth can be taught in schools and ingrained into our early ways of life as it is in many Indigenous tribes, our children may grow up understanding the land through a more loving and sustainable tone.
                </p>

                <p>A new relationship between science and literature may be achieved through the Okanagan ways of thinking presented by Armstrong and executed be Maracle in Celia’s Song. When Celia is metaphysically witnessing the scientists discuss the unexplainably monstrous snake they have evidence exists, Sam postulates that science furthers collective knowledge, but creators are needed to start the process of inquiry that scientific procedures then test (19). He also uses an anecdote of Innu knowledge prevailing over traditional scientific endeavors, in succeeding to save the trapped whales that science alone could not solve. He wisely states, “We aren’t the only ones who know things,” and I believe this perfectly surmises the open-mindedness and curiosity we need to have as Canadians in approaching complex issues, especially environmental ones. Our identity moving forward should be shaped on our ability to handle problems collectively, through Indigenous knowledge of communication and representation, which should rely on using interdisciplinary approaches to view problems as multi-faceted and complex.</p>
